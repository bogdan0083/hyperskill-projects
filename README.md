# Hyperskill Projects
This repository contains all the projects I built on [Hyperskill Platform](https://hyperskill.org/) (a.k.a "JetBrains Academy").

On Hyperskill platform I usually create a simple PoC implementation of the project and then I refactor it here to make it slick:

 * Separate domain logic from application logic
 * Add unit tests and integration tests
 * Split the code into multiple files/packages
 * Be happy!
 
## Available projects
* [Coffee Machine](https://github.com/bogdan0083/hyperskill-projects/tree/master/coffee-machine)
* [EncryptDecrypt](https://github.com/bogdan0083/hyperskill-projects/tree/master/encryptdecrypt)
