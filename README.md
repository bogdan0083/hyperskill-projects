# Hyperskill Projects
This repository contains all the projects I built on [Hyperskill Platform](https://hyperskill.org/) (so called "JetBrains Academy").

On Hyperskill platform I usually create a simple PoC implementation of the project and then I refactor it here to make it slick:

 * Separate domain logic from application logic
 * Add unit tests and integration tests
 * Split the code into multiple files/packages
 * Be happy!
 
## Available projects
TODO: create link to coffee machine repo

Right now only [Coffee Machine project]() is available but I plan to add more projects as I'm making progress. Stay tuned!

## Contributions
Contributions are always welcome! Open an issue of send a Pull Request if you think that something need to be changed. I'm always open to suggestions!
